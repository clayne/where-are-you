- Safe to update from 1.3.0

- Faster and more powerful search using Lua. Search now uses Lua [pattern matching](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5.4.1) instead of simple wildcards like in the previous version
- Customized search result list format. You can use predefined variables to add only the information you need like `[name]|[refid]~[mod]`

- Added option to be notified when a tracked NPC dies
- Added option to remove tracking marker when NPC dies
